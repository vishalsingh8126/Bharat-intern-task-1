Temperature_Converter

This is web application used to convert temperature form one unit to other unit as required by the user. It is created as a task given to me by Bharat Intern for internship project. It uses HTML for the structure of the site, CSS for the designing of the user interface and JavaScript for the functionality of the conversion.
